# The Ramaz Artist Project

This version of the site is in hand-written JS and HTML, so it cannot be used to dynamically update content from a server. I am instead starting the code from scratch, using Google's Flutter framework. I am keeping this code here as a reference, to view and make sure that the new site matches. 

I don't think the `hamburgers-master` directory is actually used here. Instead, smaller version of it named `dist` are included in every page. I'm keeping it in the repo anyhow since I don't want anything to break.
